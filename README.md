# Implementation of a Online 'Recreation Facility' Website
### Assignment 3 - COMP 482: HCI

## Challenge
Using a lo-fi prototype created in a previous assignment as a guiding point, implement the system.

- Create a functional implementation of the prototype
- Create a user interface using design concepts

## Thoughts Pre-Implementation
Even with the lo-fi protoype from the first assignment this was a challenge. The requirements for this assignment initially seemed as though it needed to be a perfect implementation that followed and applied all the HCI design principles and concepts - though that was not the case. This assignment was just an iterative jump from a lo-fi prototype to a rough hi-fi prototype with some functionality attached to it.

Creating HTML from scratch would have been too difficult, and so I wanted to use Bootstrap since it provides a very well documented HTML/CSS framework.

Without a backend somethings might be a challenge since only HTML/CSS and vanilla JavaScript is being used.

## Approach For The Implementation

1. Identify the ideal user path, assuming a perfect user, to create a basic functional implementation that outlines the interaction in the simplest way possible.

1. Find Bootstrap documentation for elements that I want by comparing them to my lo-fi prototype:
  - Basic navigation bar
  - Basic page layout (grids, columns tables)
  - Buttons and forms
  - Colour coded items for contrast

3. Using the lo-fi prototype I worked through each of the user stories (6 total). After implementing each user story, I was able to check the functionality of each part of the system. 
  - User story represented a sprint
  - Developing it in very short sprints
  - Testing at the end of each sprint

4. A second pass of the system with a focus on design and usability to highlight the missing areas.
  - Format
  - Font
  - Colour 
  - Spacing
  - Prompts and Alerts

5. A third pass through the system to highlight any areas that have missing error handling or unclear user expectations.
  - Icons that are "known" to be clicked
  - Attempts to submit empty forms

6. Final pass of the system. Remember that it's not suppose to be perfect since it's an implementation of the first assignment. Focus here is to identify the design or usability issues, and document them to write in the paper.

## Thoughts Post-Implementation
Was actually very challenging since all of the flaws really stand out to me. The assignment isn't attempting to make it perfect (as clarified by Mike in email) but being nit picky I do see a lot of changes that I would make still.

Initially starting this website was very hard. Case of analysis paralysis the first few days.

Programming this was quite challenging, albeit the Bootstrap documentation makes it simpler to mark up the HTML/CSS as opposed to me creating it. My basic understanding of JS was definitely challenged here.

My programming mind is definitely rusty, the code that I wrote could be a lot cleaner and my file organization could better thought out.
